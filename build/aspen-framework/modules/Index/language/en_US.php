<p>You have successfully installed the Aspen framework. By default, we\'ve provided two examples of ways you can use the framework.</p>
<p>First, you have an application called "Admin" which is running within the framework entirely. This demo application may be used as the basis for a website administration section, but may be changed to serve whatever needs you have.</p>
<p>Second, you have a single web page (root index.php file) which only loads the framework for support purposes.</p>
<p>We have several places where you can learn more about Aspen:</p>';
