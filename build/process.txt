# Prepare release material:

	# Document important items to note for compatibility:
		# http://docs.aspen-framework.org/wiki/Compatibility:1.0.1
	
	# Prepare a new blog entry describing the release:
		# http://blog.aspen-framework.org/wp-login.php
		
		# Title: Aspen 1.0.1 Released
		# Mark proper categories

	# Post a quick note, linking to the blog, to the google group


# Push code release package

	# The first step is to tag the current release.
		git tag -a <1.0.0> -m "tagging for release"
		git push --tags origin master


	# If you're simply going from 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1, no need to branch
	# Only If doing a new major release, create a new branch
	# Branch names may not be the same as a tag
		git branch <1.0.0final>
		git push --tags origin <1.0.0final>


	# Run aspen.sh on remote server
		sh aspen.sh 1.0.1 final Stable
